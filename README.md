### Hi there 👋


I'm Rachel. I'm currently a senior and masters student at University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science with a focus on Computer Graphcis.
My interests range from computing, physics to 3D graphics and I'm pursuing a technical path in computer graphics and interactive technologies. I'm familiar with most modern graphics backend APIs and have project experience with parallel programming, rendering and physically based simulation.

Eager to learn and always motivated for tackling new challenges.
